        this project was inspired by safari constantly warning me that
        my passwords were appearing in data leaks. After spending some
        time learning about different encryption methods and database management, 
        I created a simple CLI using Python. However, this felt too impersonal
        for my (personal) passwords, so I decided to build a personalized GUI. 
        I used PyCryptoDome for encryption/decryption and Tkinter 
        for the front-end. The application features adding, deleting, and viewing 
        credentials, as well as changing the master password. All data is securely 
        stored using AES-256 encryption.
